# a simple program that creates a binary tree for the huffman encoding 
that's it.

In "src/Main.java", is some example code with example inputs.

The program works with any datatype not just Strings.

I will use this program for my other project, where I try to create my own compressed image file format, using different compression algorithms, including the Huffman Encoding.
